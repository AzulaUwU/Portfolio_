            <p1 class="text-danger">My name is Krithi Shri, and I am going to go to seventh grade next year. I am currently biding my time by playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but in the route in which I am ditching Zelda and catching myself a giant horse. This is to survive boredom. And a practically spiceless, vegetarian life. I LOVE spicy food. Not the mild type, like in Whole Foods, but like a nice plate of chicken biryani (Really good food), or tandoori stuff (Also really good food). As you can probably tell, I have a certain obsession with food. I'm also pretty good at drawing from refrence pictures, but I don't rely on them. I draw abstract as well, and while I'm horrible at painting, I am taking classes hosted by my aunt. Thank you for reading!</p1>
